Exploratory Data Analysis on Student Marks

This script demonstrates how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on student marks using Python. The code calculates essential statistical measures such as mean, median, quartiles, and standard deviation for two sets of student marks (First Term and Second Term). It also visualizes the distribution of marks through histograms and box plots.
Features:

    Mean Calculation: The average marks of students.
    Median Calculation: The middle value when the marks are sorted.
    Quartiles: The first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles to understand the distribution.
    Standard Deviation: Measure of the amount of variation in the marks.
    Visualizations:
        Histogram with KDE: Shows the distribution of marks along with the kernel density estimate.
        Box Plot: Illustrates the spread of marks and identifies potential outliers.

Requirements:

    Python 3.x
    NumPy
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn

Usage:

    Install the required libraries:
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn

Run the script:
    python marks_analysis.py

    Output:
        FirstTermNormal.jpg: Histogram and KDE plot of first term marks.
        FirstTermBoxPlot.jpg: Box plot of first term marks.
        SecondTermNormal.jpg: Histogram and KDE plot of second term marks.
        SecondTermBoxPlot.jpg: Box plot of second term marks.
